## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app

> of the app.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

I made an App called Foodfit which calculates the amount of calories 
using an API call Fitness Calculator from m alaaddin Ã§elik. It tells you
how much calories you will need to consume based on your age,
height, weight, gender, activity level, and goals(maintain, gain weight, 
lose weight). My app then uses that calorie amount and inputs it into 
spoonacular Recipe - Food - Nutrition AP by David. This API provides
a list of recipes you can make. And so my apps will return 9 potential 
recipe names along with the nutritional fact and images of the food for you
to pick so you can reach your calorie goals.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Working on this project helps me to better understand how to use API 
and search for APIs to potentially use.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I had to start over from scratch because my first idea failed
on me because the API I was using did not have the ability to 
do what I wanted. But if I was to start over again I would
want to look at some more interesting APIs so I can play
around with some stuff I am more interested in.
